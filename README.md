# AgariToad
Basically this is a poor ripoff of Agar.io, but without multiplayer. <br /> 
Avoid the larger toads, and eat smaller ones to grow larger. <br />
The game's dev-log is located in the `lib/DevLog.txt`.<br />
<br />
Goal of the game:<br />
To eat smaller toads then the player to grow bigger to eat
the bigger toads in the game. You take damage if you collide with
a larger toad than the size of your player. 
The player has 3 lives.
if you lose just wait for a second and the game will restart
automaticaly.
